	<h1>From Kids To Code</h1>
	<p>For over 20 years I have worked with urban youth, directing after-school programs and summer camps, while working with a diverse group of people from all over the world. Though my career has been people focused, I have always had a "techie" side. Transitioning into the Special Projects Coordinator gave me an opportunity to develop these skills further. I found myself learning many new things which brought a renewed energy and a change in focus to my career path. Starting with front end web development, my ultimate goal is to become a full stack developer. Below are some examples of my recent work that will demonstrate my background further and serve as milestones on my journey "from kids to code".</p>

			<h1>Student Database Project</h1>
			<p><em>Project Summary: </em>  A customized database application built in Microsoft Access that integrates student data from the 8 different programs in the organization and tracks key metrics. This data is then used in reporting to stakeholders, guiding in department decision making, and facilitating administrative tasks.</p>
			<p><em>Skills Used/Demonstrated: </em> This project required a lot of planning, organization, and determination. At the start I was unfamiliar with the tools so I had to find resources to learn from and break each large problem down into smaller sections. I learned how to do testing in order to check different use cases before release.  I also trained users in how to use the database. During the project I used feedback from users as well as my own experience to improve the end product, making the interface more user friendly and adding functionality.</p>
			<p><em>Lessons Learned: </em> Early in the project it surprised me how differently people interacted with the same screen. This was important for me to remember when designing or making changes - not to assume the users interpretation is always the same as my own. While the database is fully functioning, I believe I would have benefitted from working with an experienced team; allowing for feedback and improved efficiency.</p>

			<h1>Sponsorship Donor Retention - A Presentation Project</h1>	
			<p><em>Project Summary: </em> Using Adobe Spark Pages, I created a system that would automatically send a message to sponsors during the final month of their sponsorship. This led to an increase in sponsorship renewals. </p>	
			<p><em>Skills Used/Demonstrated: </em> This project is an example of being resourceful and taking initiative as this was not something I was assigned or asked to do but rather a proposal I brought to the team. I came across these Adobe Spark Pages which make creating a very polished presentation quick and easy (and free). I combined this resource with our email client service and created an auto send to sponsors in their final month of sponsorship. </p>	
			<p><em>Lessons Learned: </em> It is always worth it to keep an eye on new apps and technology. This was a fairly quick project to create and it runs on its own all year.</p>

			<h1>Intern Recruitment - A Presentation Project</h1>
			<p><em>Project Summary: </em>Urban Promise recruits many interns each year. Using FlowVella I made a self-contained presentation that could be sent to prospective interns and answer common questions.</p>
			<p><em>Skills Used/Demonstrated: </em> This was another proposal I made after researching FlowVella. On this project I worked with a small team to generate the content for the presentation. I also included this to provide some visual context to my former role as a program director. It gives a good overview of the program and the interns this is meant to help recruit made up the core of the staff teams I directed. Most of the photos used are actually from my specific program site.</p>
			<p><em>Lessons Learned: </em>As with the sponsorship message system, I was able to leverage new technology to help improve the organization's efficiency by being proactive and making the effort to fully understand the software available.</p>
