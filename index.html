<div id="intro">
	<h1>FROM KIDS TO CODE</h1>
	<p>Most of my career has been people focused, but I have always had a "techie" side. After working with urban youth for over 20 years I had the opportunity to move into a position that enabled me to develop these interests more. I found myself learning so many new things which brought a renewed energy and a change in focus to my career path. Below are some examples of my recent work that will demonstrate my background further and serve as milestones on my journey "from kids to code".</p>

			<h1>Database Project</h1>
			<p>This project required a great deal of organization and planning. It required testing and development in response to user feedback. Problem solving was a skill I used frequently throughout this project. It required paitent perseverance and determination; breaking down the problems into smaller steps.</p>
			<p>This project is also a good example of how I am able to tackle the unknown. I didn't know anything about SQL, SharePoint, or how to write a data macro when I started. I figured things out by reading, looking at working examples, and of course, YouTube. This database application works but I was working alone so I do not know if I coded things efficiently so I greatly look forward to working on a team with experienced programmers; to learn from and to be able to get feedback on my code.</p>

			<h1>Sponsorship Retention</h1>	
			<p>This project is an example of being resourceful and how I take initiative. I came across these Adobe Spark Pages which make creating a very polished presentation quick and easy (and free). I combined this resource with our email client service and created an auto send to sponsors in their final month of sponsorship. This was a way to upgrade a simple thank you email and encouraged sponsors to renew and the result was an increase in sponsorship retention.</p>

			<h1>Intern Recruitment</h1>
			<p>The goal was to create an updated resource to use in recruiting intern staff - something that would answer all the basic FAQ's. FlowVella is another free presentation resource I discovered and proposed for this project. A small team worked on creating the content and I pulled it all together. Once created it is able to be shared easily by weblink. A small secondary benefit is that some analytics are available which enabled us to get a general idea of how much use the link was getting.</p>

	<h1>My Family</h1>
	<p>Originally I am from MA. I met my wife, Sandy (from MI), while at college in Chicago. After college (literally graduation weekend) we married and moved back to MA. We have two children and moved to Camden, NJ when they were 4 and 5 years old. Our daughter Ashley is currently finishing nursing school and Benjamin is an electronic engineer. Sandy works at UrbanPromise International.</p>

<div id="interests">
	<h1>My Interests</h1>
	<p>My main interest is music. I have played guitar (acoustic and electric) since I was 12 years old and it is still my favorite way to spend my free time. I have taught guitar lessons from time to time and have done some recording and performing but mostly play just for fun. My musical taste is wide ranging but my favorite genres would be Jazz, Blues, and Acoustic guitar. WXPN is my favorite radio station and I spend a lot of time on the NPR music website - big fan of All Songs Considered and The Tiny Desk Concerts.2</p>
