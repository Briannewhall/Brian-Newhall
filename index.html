			<h1>From Kids To Code</h1>
			<p>For over 20 years I have worked with urban youth, directing after-school programs and summer camps, while working with a diverse group of people from all over the world. Though my career has been people focused, I have always had a "techie" side. Transitioning into the Special Projects Coordinator gave me an opportunity to develop these skills further. I found myself learning many new things which brought a renewed energy and a change in focus to my career path. Starting with front end web development, my ultimate goal is to become a full stack developer. Below are some examples of my recent work that will demonstrate my background further and serve as milestones on my journey "from kids to code".</p>

		<h1>Family</h1>
		<p>Originally I am from MA. I met my wife, Sandy (from MI), while at college in Chicago. After college (literally graduation weekend) we married and moved back to MA. We have two children and moved to Camden, NJ when they were 4 and 5 years old. Our daughter Ashley is currently finishing nursing school and Benjamin is an electronics engineer. Sandy works at UrbanPromise International.</p>

		<h1>Interests</h1>
		<p>My main interest is music. My musical taste is wide ranging but my favorite genres would be Jazz, Blues, and Acoustic guitar. WXPN is my favorite local radio station and I spend a lot of time on the NPR music website - big fan of All Songs Considered and The Tiny Desk Concerts. I have played guitar (acoustic and electric) since I was 12 years old and it is still my favorite way to spend my free time. I have taught guitar lessons from time to time and have done some recording and performing but mostly play just for fun. </p>
